OpenERP - Master repo

This is the master repo, meaning that it controls the submodules of OpenERP
individual components, like Server, Addons, Client etc. It does NOT contain
the code of these projects, but only points to them. Still, it has a few
files with build instructions and tests.

Usage instructions.
Clone this repository!
  $ git clone <this-url>

Checkout the correct head (ask inside for details).
  $ git checkout <ref>

Then, init and update the submodules. This may take some time

  $ git submodule init
  $ git submodule update
    # note that the 'addons' repository is quite large (few hundreds of MB)
    # so it will take some time to download

Play around, explore, hack and contribute to OpenERP...
